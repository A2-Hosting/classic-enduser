Derivative Size Constraints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are given the option to set the maximum image sizes for Fullsize,
Thumbnails, and Square Thumbnails in pixels for the longest side of the
image. By default the following sizes are set, but you may change them:

-   Fullsize Image: 600px;
-   Thumbnail: 300 px;
-   Square Thumbnail: 200 px.

Please note that changes to these settings will only affect files
uploaded after you have made the changes; it does not retroactively
re-size existing files. If you want to change existing files, you will
need to install the [Derivative Images
plugin](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/DerivativeImages)

Those with access to the serve files may also [manage thumbnail creation
settings](http://omeka.org/codex/Configuring_Thumbnail_Creation)

Display Settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Results Per Page: You may edit the number of items to be displayed
    per page in both the admin and public items/browse pages by changing
    the "Results per Page" settings. The default number is 10 for both.



-   Show Empty Elements: If you wish to only show metadata fields
    containing data on the public pages, do not check this box. The
    default setting is unchecked. If you wish show all metadata (empty
    and filled) fields, check this box.



-   Show Element Set Headings: If you do not wish the element set
    headings (e.g. "Dublin Core," "Person Item Type Metadata") to
    display on the public pages of the site, uncheck this box. The
    default setting is checked.
