Managing Tags 2.0
=================


Tags are keywords or phrases that describe a piece of data. They are
non-hierarchical labels that classify your content so that it is easily
found.

To manage your tags, sign into the Omeka admin panel and select Tags
from the left-hand navigation bar. This displays all the tags associated
with items in your archive. You may edit tags, delete tags, view items
associated with individual tags, and sort tags.

Each tag used on your site appears as a unit which gives you 1) the
number of items with that tag, 2) the name of the tag, and the 3) option
to delete the tag.


 View Tagged Items
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To view items associated with an individual tag, click on the number to
the left of the name of your tag. A browse page opens displaying only
items tagged with the tag you clicked.

Edit a Tag 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Editing a tag allows you to rename a tag. Tags edited in the admin panel
change on all items across the site wherever they appear.

-   Click on the name of the tag you wish to edit.
-   Enter changes you would like to make in the field.
-   Hit Enter and your tag is saved with its new name.

Delete a Tag 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Deleting a tag removes all occurrences of that tag across all items.

-   Choose the tag you wish to delete from the select menu
-   Select the X to the right of the tag.
-   A window opens with the question, "Are you sure?" Click Delete, and
    that tag is permanently deleted across your Omeka items. (If you
    change your mind, close the query window by clicking on the X in the
    upper right hand corner.)

Sort Tags
-----------------------------------------------------------

The menu above your tags display allows you to sort all of your tags.
The browse tags panel displays all the tags associated with items in
your archive, weighted by frequency used. You may sort and view all your
tags by most popular, least popular, alphabetically, or by tags most
recently added to items.
