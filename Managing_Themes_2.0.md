Managing Themes 2.0
===================


Themes control the the look and feel of your public Omeka website.
Themes can be customized in the /admin and also by editing theme files
inside the Omeka installation on your server.

Themes are a collection of template files and helper function that use
data in your Omeka site and display that data to end users.

these steps:

1.  Download and unzip the file on your desktop.
2.  Open your FTP client.
3.  Use your FTP login info to access your site.

    Omeka install, and may be located in the public\_html folder
5.  Open the /themes folder
6.  Upload your new plugin folder into your Omeka website's
    /plugins folder. Sometimes the unpacked plugin is inside a folder of
    the same name so make sure you are uploading the correct directory.
    NB: your plugin must be inside the /plugins folder
7.  Log in to your Omeka admin panel
8.  Navigate to Appearance in the top nav bar. You should immediately be
    in the Themes section.

Configurations let you make choices about the look of your site,
including adding a logo and homepage text, managing featured elements,
and adding footer text. Each configuration is unique to each theme and
will be saved with that theme.

1.  Click "Configure Theme" to customize your site. The following
    choices are available in admin/themes:

-   Choose a logo file. You may upload a logo file that will replace the
    site title in the header of the theme. Recommended maximum width for
    the logo is 500px.
-   Choose a header background image: Upload an image file that will
    display across the top of your public website.
