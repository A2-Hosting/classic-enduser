Project Planning Case Studies
=============================

<div id="primary">

To help project managers think about how to organize an Omeka site, we
offer a few case studies of projects developed at CHNM. Please add your
own case study as you finish your Omeka sites.

First, for advice on thinking about what your site is about, how to
handle images, how to buy a domain name, and other details, you might
want to browse through [Digital History: A Guide to Gathering,
Preserving, and, Presenting the Past on the
Web](http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory), by Dan Cohen and Roy
Rosenzweig.

You may also want to consult articles written about using Omeka for
teaching, building exhibits, and managing collections in our public
[Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/omeka/items).

### <span id="Tips_on_dissecting_an_Omeka_site" class="mw-headline"> Tips on dissecting an Omeka site </span>

-   When trying to determine how to organize and build your site, take a
    look at the [Showcase](../showcase.1.html). When viewing a site
    built in Omeka look at different page URLs to clue you in as to how
    the project is organized.
    -   Example: When looking at [Making the History of
        1989](http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989), you see there is a section of
        Introductory Essays. When you click on this section, or any of
        the essays, you will see from the URL that this section was
        built as an exhibit. Here is the link to the
        <http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/exhibits/intro/poland>.
    -   Example: Look at [Children and Youth in
        History](http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/) Click on the Case Studies
        tab, and you will find that each case study is an individual
        item in the archive. They created an item type called "case
        study" and this is what is called to display for this section.
        See, <http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/122>.

### <span id="Tips_on_Planning" class="mw-headline"> Tips on Planning </span>

See [Site Planning Tips](Site_Planning_Tips.html "Site Planning Tips")
for more specific ways to plan ahead for building an Omeka site.

Before starting to work with Omeka, it is useful to sketch out
wireframes of site to help to plan how you want the public site to look
and how you want visitors to access and use the content in your site.
Planning the content and then think about how Omeka can work best for
your project.

**Items** The item is the building block of your site. First add the
objects and materials you want to display in your site, then you can
build an exhibit with them or display categories of items organized by
collections or tags.

\
 Diagram of an Archive of Items:

-   Items: Each item contains Dublin Core and Item Type metadata; an
    item can belong to one collection at a time, and have an infinite
    number of tags. Items may contain many or no files.
-   Collections: May be comprised of different items. Items may only
    belong to one collection a time.
-   Tags: Tags can be added to any item, and an item may contain an
    infinite number of tags.

[![Archive itemsrelations
wiki.jpg](https://omeka.org/c/images/f/f8/Archive_itemsrelations_wiki.jpg)](https://omeka.org/codex/File:Archive_itemsrelations_wiki.jpg)

-   It is wise to determine before you start building the item archive
    what type of consistencies you desire in your metadata--this may be
    especially true for fields such as date, publisher, creator, et al.
    -   You may also want to establish a controlled tagging schema. You
        can add tags before building your archive to help control vocab
        and spelling. Tags can help you pull together different items
        for the purpose of arranging them on a map or creating
        navigational links to browse items with a specific tag.
-   Exhibits: The exhibit builder is not necessarily only for building
    museum-like exhibits, as shown by the examples above. This function
    can be used to publish essays or teaching materials that draw upon
    the items in your archive.
    -   Before you build an exhibit, it is easier if you have a
        storyboard or outline that spells out the sections, pages, and
        items for each page.
