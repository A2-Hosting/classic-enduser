Managing Items 2.0
==================


Items are building blocks in Omeka. To build your digital collections
website, you must first add items.

Before Adding Items 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may want to consult the
[Site\_Planning\_Tips](Site_Planning_Tips.html "Site Planning Tips")
page to think about how to build your site and what you want to do with
your items.

You may also want to think about what type of information you plan to
share using the [Dublin Core
Metadata](http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/) fields before
adding and describing items. You may also want to read the
[Describing\_Items](https://omeka.org/codex/Describing_Items "Describing Items")
page for a brief explanation of using metadata in Omeka Items.

Add an Item 
---------------------------------------------------------------

[![Add

1.  From your items page (mywebsite.org/admin/items) click the "Add an
    Item" button.
2.  This takes you to the admin/items/add page where you see a
    navigation bar across the top pointing you to different stages of
    adding an item. At any time, you may check the “Public and/or
    “Featured” boxes to the right of the item form. You may also change
    this status from the /admin/items page without needing to re-open
    the individual item.
3.  The first tab shows the Dublin Core metafields. These are available
    for every item in the archive. Each field can have multiple values;
    Simply click the "Add Input" button beside each field title to add a
    new input for that field.
4.  The Item Type Metadata tab lets you choose a specific item type for
    the object you are adding. Once you choose the type by using the
    drop-down menu, relevant metadata fields appear for you to complete.
    (See
    [Managing\_Item\_Types\_2.0](Managing_Item_Types_2.0.html "Managing Item Types 2.0")
    for information about adding/editing item types.)
5.  The Files tab lets you upload files to an item. Clicking the "Add
    Another File" link will reveal another field for adding a file. You
    can associate any number of files to an item. Read more about
    [Managing\_Files\_2.0](Managing_Files_2.0.html "Managing Files 2.0").
6.  The Tags tab allows you add keyword tags to your item.
7.  Assign items to a collection: To the right of the page, under the
    "Add Item" button is a drop-down menu where you can assign your item
    to a collection. Remember, items can only belong to one collection.
8.  Be sure to click the "Add Item" button to save your data.

###  Adding HTML elements to Items

Each metadata field's text may be enhanced using basic HMTL tags. Check
the HTML box below the text box to enable a visual HTML editor. For more
instructions, see:
[Using\_HTML\_Editor-TinyMCE](Using_HTML_Editor-TinyMCE.html "Using HTML Editor-TinyMCE")

### Properties of Items

-   Items: Each item contains Dublin Core and Item Type metadata; an
    item can belong to one collection at a time, and have an infinite
    number of tags. Items may contain many or no files.
-   Collections: May be comprised of different items. Items may only
    belong to one collection a time.
-   Tags: Tags can be added to any item, and an item may contain an
    infinite number of tags.

Edit an Item

    associated with that item, use the Details link under the
    item's title. You may also use the blue Show Details tab, which will
    display details for every item on the page.

    you don't lose your changes.

Delete an Item

found below the title on the admin/items page. You will be asked to
confirm this action.

"Delete" button, found to the right of the page under the link to View
