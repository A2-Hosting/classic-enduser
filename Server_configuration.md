Suggested Specs for memory
--------------------------------------------------------------

-   Low usage: 512MB RAM
-   Medium usage: 1GB RAM
-   Heavy usage: 2-4GB RAM


Hard drive
---------------------------------------------------

Hard drive space is totally contingent upon the size of their archive. If you calculate the size of the data, and then multiply that by 3 (copy of original and then thumbnail copies and such), that will give you a good estimate. Say you have 20GB of data, you probably won't need more than 60GB of hard drive space.

Processor Speed
--------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, we think the faster the better. If omeka is the only thing running, anything over 600MHz will work well, but 1GHz and above are best.
