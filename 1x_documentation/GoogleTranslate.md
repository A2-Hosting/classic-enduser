Plugins/GoogleTranslate
=======================


[Plugins](../Plugins.1.html "Plugins")


The Google Translate plugin offers users the ability to translate the
administrative interface into a language of their choice. The plugin
relies on the [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/) toolkit.

1.  Install and activate the plugin
    [Download](../../files/plugins/GoogleTranslate-1.1-1.0.zip).
2.  After the plugin is activated, a small drop-down list of many
    languages will appear in the admin and public theme footer. The
    default language is always English.
3.  Keep in mind that users--admin and public--must choose the language
    each time they revisit the website. This plugin may not be a perfect
    translation of all elements in your site, but it does provide an
    easy way to make a site available to a diverse group of
    language speakers.
