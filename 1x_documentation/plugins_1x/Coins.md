Plugins/Coins
=============

The COinS plugin embeds citation metadata into the pages of your Omeka site for each item. COinS (ContextObjects in Spans) is "a simple, ad hoc community specification for publishing OpenURL references in HTML."[\[1\]](http://ocoins.info/)

When installed, the COinS plugin makes your items viewable to [online bibliographic tools such as Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) by automatically embedding citation metadata in your website. This plugin facilitates online research as well as interoperability with other systems.
