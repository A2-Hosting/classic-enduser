*This documentation for Omeka versions up to 1.5 only*

Find the general site settings by clicking on the Settings button in the right corner of your dashboard, or go to, /admin/settings.

-   In the General Settings tab, you may edit the fields you filled in when you installed your site and add other information, including: Site Title, Administrator Email, Copyright Info, site Authors, and site Description.
-   Set a tag delimiter: If you wish to separate tags by a space or a character other than a comma, specify in the Tag Delimiter field. Beware, that if you change the setting after tags have been created, you run the risk of splitting tags.
-   Image sizing: You are given the option to set the maximum image sizes for Fullsize, Thumbnails, and Square Thumbnails in pixels for the longest side. In versions below 1.3, the default value of Fullsize is set at 600pixels.
-   You may edit the number of items to be displayed per page in both the admin and public pages. The default is 10 for both.
-   Do you want all metadata fields to display publicly whether filled in or not? If you wish show all fields, check the box next to "Show empty elements."
-   The setting to Enable Prototype should not need changing unless you are having difficulties with a legacy plugin that requires the Prototype JavaScript Library.
-   If you are receiving Imagemagick errors, click the Test button here to be sure that the path to its directly is properly routed.
