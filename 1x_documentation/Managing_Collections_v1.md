title: Managing Collections in Omeka Classic 1x
---
*This documentation for Omeka versions up to 1.5 only*

Collections may be used in a variety of contexts that make the most sense for your archive. It is not necessary to follow a traditional interpretation of a collection, say by owner or donor. In Omeka, you can also use tags to organize similar items into categories.

Screencast Tutorial
----------------------------------------------------------------

Watch a screencast tutorial on [managing collections and tags](../1x_documentation/1x_Screencasts/CollectionsandTags1.0.mov).

Create a Collection
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Click on the "Collections" tab in the /admin interface top navigation bar. Any collections you create will be listed on the other/admin/collections page.
2.  Click, "Add a Collection."
3.  Name and describe your collection, or add the name of a donor/collector.
4.  Determine if you want this collection visible to the public.
5.  You may associate an item with this collection, and all others you create, when adding or editing an item.
6.  Be sure to click "Save Collection" to save your newly-created collection.

Edit a Collection
----------------------------------------------------------------

You may edit collections at any time by going to the Collections tab and
clicking the edit button found to the right of the named collection.

Adding Items to Collections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   First you must create the collection, and then you may add an item to it through the add/edit item form. See [Managing Items](../1x_documentation/Managing_Items_v1.md).
-   An item may only belong to one collection a time. You may switch
    collection associations for an item at any time.

Browsing Collections
----------------------------------------------------------------

In the admin/collections section, you may sort collections by clicking Name or Date Added

Nested Collections 
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to create nested collections and you are running Omeka version 1.5 or above, you may download and use the [Collection Tree](../1x_documentation/Plugins_1x/collection-tree.1.html) plugin.
