What Is a Theme
--------------------------------------------

Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your public Omeka site. They are a collection of template files and helper function that use data in your Omeka archive and display those data to end users. Themes include files for images (.gif, .jpg, .png), style sheets (.css) and various code files (.php).

Installing a Theme
------------------------------------------------------

To install and activate a new theme, do the following:

1.  [Download](../download/themes/index.html) and unzip a theme from our Theme directory.
2.  Use an FTP client to upload the theme folder you've unzipped into a directory named "themes" in your Omeka install. You'll already see folders for the pre-packaged themes in this directory.
3.  Log in to the admin panel, navigate to Settings &gt; Themes, select the radio input beside the theme you wish to use, and click the "Switch Theme" button.

Creating Themes
----------------------------------------------------------------

One of the easiest ways to develop your own theme is to modify one of the pre-existing ones in our themes directory. Hacking on a CSS file, you can create a dramatically different website with minimal work.

If you're interested in creating new themes, check out the [Theme Writing Best Practices](../1x_documentation/Theme_Writing_Best_Practices.md) to get started, and use the [Theme API](../1x_documentation/Theme_API.md) page as a reference.
