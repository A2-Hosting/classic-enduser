Managing Tags
---

*This documentation for Omeka versions up to 1.5 only*

The Tags section allows you to manage the tags you and other users have created in your installation.

Screencast Tutorial 
---------------------------------------------------------------

Watch a screencast on [managing collections and tags](../1x_documentation/1x_Screencasts/CollectionsandTags1.0.mov).

Browse Tags 
---------------------------------------------------------------

The browse tags panel displays all the tags associated with items in your archive, weighted by frequency used. You may sort all of your tags by most popular, least popular, alphabetically, or by the tags most recently added to items. Clicking on a tag will take you to the items/browse page, displaying only items tagged with the tag you clicked.

Edit a Tag
-------------------------------------------------------------

Editing a tag allows you to rename a tag across all instances that it occurs.

1.  Choose a tag that wish to edit, and rename it in the text box below.
2.  Click "Save Changes" and your tag will be saved with its new name.

Delete a Tag
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Deleting a tag removes all occurrences of that tag across all items, for all users. To completely delete a tag:

1.  Choose the tag you wish to delete from the select menu
2.  Click "Delete tag" button. That tag will then be permanently deleted from the installation.
