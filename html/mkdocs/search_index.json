What sections will this website include ? \nTypical top level navigation and sections for a typical Omeka site include:\n  -  Items : links to a browseable list of items, sortable by type of item and tags.\n  -  Collections : groups of items, public can dig through collection to find items.\n  -  Exhibits : Exhibits contain interpretative text and rely on items/sources/objects as their building blocks.\n  - About: a  simple page  good for publishing project descriptions, credits, rights, et al\n  - Keyword Search box \u2013 option to link to advanced search page  *Note: the labels for Items, Collections, Exhibits,   What will I do with items in this website? \nThe item is the building block of your site. First add the objects and materials you want to display in your site. Add  descriptions  using some or all of the 20 standard Dublin Core fields, plus additional item type-specific fields. Once you have items in the Omeka archive, then you can build an exhibit with them or display categories of items organized by collections or tags.\n- Determine the types of items/sources/objects you plan to use in this site: (ie, Document, Still Image, Moving Image, Audio, et al),\n- Do you want to modify any of the item type fields or types? See  Managing Item Types  for additional types and explanations.\n- Do you need additional core fields? Install the  Dublin Core Extended  plugin.\n- It is wise to determine before you start building the item archive what type of consistencies you desire in your metadata--this may be especially true for fields such as date, publisher, creator, et al.\n- Would you like to establish your own Controlled Vocabulary for specific metadata fields, to make it easier for you team to enter consistent data? Install the  Simple Vocab  plugin.\n- Do you need Library of Congress subject headings? Install  Library of Congress Subject Headings  plugin.\n- Do you want to establish a controlled tagging schema? You may  add tags  to individual items and exhibits. Before building your archive you may want to devise this schema to help control vocab and spelling. Tags can help you pull together different items for the purpose of arranging them on a map or creating navigational links to browse items with a specific tag.\n- Do you have materials in other databases or repositories? You may be able to batch add them into your Omeka site. Can items be exported in a Comma Separated Value format? Try the  CSV Import  plugin.\n- Is there an OAI-PMH harvestable set? Try the  OAI-PMH Harvester  plugin.\n- Do you have hundreds of files, or large media files? Use the  Dropbox  plugin.\n- Do you want to display items on a map? Install the  Geolocation  plugin, you must geolocate each item individually.\n- Are you interested in collecting materials from your visitors through a web form, such as a story or textual reflection, photos, videos, et al. Install the  Contribution  plugin to facilitate collecting.\n- Do you want to build an exhibit with your items? Install the  Exhibit Builder  plugin.  Decisions for Displaying Items \n- Do you want to add social bookmarking icons to the bottom of\nitems/show to allow users to share links to that item w/their social networks? Install the  Social Bookmarking  plugin.\n- Do you want to open commenting on items (only available at item    level, and for all items or none)? Install the  Commenting  plugin.\n-   Do you want to create and print QR Codes that link visitors in a physical place to individual items in your Omeka site? Install the  Bar Code and Reports  plugin.\n-   Do you have documents that you wish users to read through on the screen rather than downloading them? Install the  DocsViewer  plugin.",

Click\"Upgrade\" to update your database to reflect the new data model and finish the upgrade. \n\n\nOmeka 1.2.1 and earlier only\n: Instead of redirecting, older Omeka versions will show an alert on your dashboard with a link to follow if the database needs to be upgraded.\n\n\nIf you weren't redirected when you went to your administrative panel, then no database changes were required, so you're done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting an upgrade\n\n\nIf you have problems upgrading, double-check to make sure that the db.ini, congif.ini (in the \napplication/config\n folder), and .htaccess files are present and have the correct information.",

If you have access to the config.ini file, you can manage \nthumbnail configuration\n\n\nFile Size Limitations\n\n\nPlease check with your server administrator, because these settings are server specific and not imposed by the Omeka system.\n\n\nThese limitations vary from server to server and we cannot change this for you. If you have a problem uploading files, please first check with your hosting service or your local server administrator.\n\n\nBatch Add Files\n\n\nTo upload more than one file at a time, you may download and install the \nDropbox\n plugin. It allows you to upload multiple files directly into a folder on your server that you can then add in the items admin interface. \n\n\nFile Metadata\n\n\nYou may add full Dublin Core metadata for every file uploaded.\n\n\nTo add metadata, click the Edit button found to the right of the file name in admin/items/edit. You also may view or edit file metadata from the admin/items/show by clicking the file name under the heading \"File Metadata.\"\n\n\n\n\nMedia Files\n\n\nTo keep up with the changing browser support landscape, as of version 2.4 Omeka uses HTML 5 audio and video tags when embedding audio and video, instead of the object and embed tags used by previous versions.\n\n\nThis change means generally better support on newer browsers, but worse support on older ones and for older video formats especially.\n\n\nBy choosing from a few well-supported formats for audio and video files, you can provide a much better experience for your users across different platforms and devices.\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nMP4\n\n\nThe MP4 container (.mp4 or .m4v) is the best-supported video format across browsers and platforms. By far the best choice for video that will work well across different browsers is a .mp4 file, with H.264 video and AAC audio.\n\n\n.mp4 files can contain other types of video (or audio), including newer ones like H.265, and older ones like MPEG-4 Visual. Any video codec other than H.264 has \u2018\u2019\u2019much\u2019\u2019\u2019 worse browser support.\n\n\nOther Formats\n\n\nThe WebM (.webm) container with VP8 or VP9 video is supported by several browsers, but Internet Explorer and Safari are notable and significant exceptions.\n\n\nThe Ogg (.ogg, .ogv) container and Theora video are supported by some browsers, but there is little support among mobile browsers and no support at all on IE or Safari.\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nMP3\n\n\nMP3 (.mp3) is one of the most common formats for compressed audio, and it enjoys wide support across browsers and from desktop to mobile.\n\n\nAAC\n\n\nAAC is a somewhat newer format than MP3, but it also is well supported in most browsers. The widest support is for AAC in an MP4 container (this usually carries the file extension .m4a), with somewhat lesser support for other containers and formats (often found with a .aac extension).\n\n\nOther Formats\n\n\nWAV or WAVE (.wav) audio is supported by most browsers (with the notable exception of Internet Explorer). The major downside for use on the Web is that WAV audio is uncompressed, so it takes up vastly more storage space and bandwidth than the compressed formats listed above. If feasible, it\u2019s best to use one of those instead of WAV.\n\n\nOgg Vorbis audio (.ogg, .oga) is a compressed format like MP3 and AAC, but it has much less widespread support. Expect Vorbis audio to only work on Firefox, Chrome, and Android.\n\n\nOpus (.opus) is one of the newer available audio formats. For the time being, it has a similar problem as Vorbis: a lack of support among browsers, but there are signs that Opus could gain more support in the future.\n\n\nLegacy Formats\n\n\nThere are a lot of media files out there that aren\u2019t in any of the formats listed here. With certain add ons or on certain platforms (like Safari on the Mac in many cases), it can be possible to embed some of those files with HTML 5, but expect many or most users to be unable to play them. Browser plugins can also play many file types, but browsers are steadily reducing and removing their support for these kinds of plugins.\n\n\nFor old media, often the best choice is to just present a download link so the viewer can play or convert the file locally. This is what Omeka does when it doesn\u2019t recognize a file type or when a browser reports that it can\u2019t play a file.\n\n\nFile formats which result in a download link, rather than an embedded playback, include: \n- Video: avi, wmv\n- Audio: diff (except Safari), midi, wha\n\n\nIf you do not see a format listed here that you think should be, try it out and let us know the results.",

Examples of still images are: paintings, drawings, graphic designs, plans and maps. Recommended best practice is to assign the type \"text\" to images of textual materials.\n\n\nWebsite: A resource comprising of a web page or web pages and all related assets (such as images, sound and video files, etc.).\n\n\nEvent: A non-persistent, time-based occurrence. Metadata for an event provides descriptive information that is the basis for discovery of the purpose, location, duration, and responsible agents associated with an event. Examples include an exhibition, webcast, conference, workshop, open day, performance, battle, trial, wedding, tea party.\n\n\nEmail: A resource containing textual messages and binary attachments sent electronically from one person to another or one person to many people.\n\n\nLesson Plan: Instructional materials with fields that include duration(length of time involved), standards, objectives, materials, and lesson plan text.\n\n\nHyperlink: Title, URL, Description or annotation.\n\n\nPerson: An individual, biographical data, birth and death, etc.\n\n\nInteractive Resource: A resource requiring interaction from the user to be understood, executed, or experienced.

In the screenshot, you can see that in addition to data about items,\ncollections, tags, etc. being available via the API, the Exhibit Builder plugin is also installed, and that information about exhibits and individual exhibit pages is exposed through the API.\n\n\nAPI Keys and Permissions\n\n\nPermissions to modify any data are only given to existing users of your Omeka site who have been given a key by an administrator. See more information on users,\n\nManaging_Users_2.0\n.\n\n\nThe same permissions by role apply to the API, so users with the\n\u201cresearcher\u201d role will not be able to do anything through the API that they cannot do through the regular admin interface. Users with admin or super levels can obtain keys that could allow their applications to show, browse, add, edit, and delete your site resources. Be careful when generating API keys.\n\n\nThe chart shows only what is possible via the API. So, for example, it shows that it is possible to delete an item via the API, if the user has sufficient permissions. However, even a super user interacting with the API will not be able to add or delete users.\n\n\n\n\nTo give a user an API key, click on the Users tab in the top navigation bar when logged into the Omeka admin.\n\n\nFind the user, and click on \nedit\n for their profile.\n\n\nClick \"API Keys\" in the tabs at the top of the page.\n\n\nGive the new key a label (best practices are to describe how it will be used).

All contributions are private by default and require a site administrator to review and make them public on the Omeka site. The plugin can also automatically add a reCAPTCHA box at the bottom of each form to prevent spam-bots from spamming your website. Contribution also offers options for users to create guest accounts that make it easier for one user to submit multiple items. \n\n\nOther plugins can be integrated into the Contribution form, such as \nSimple Vocab\n for creating dropdown menu choices, and \nGeolocation\n for inviting users to map their submissions or locations. \n\n\nInstalling and configuring the Contribution plugin requires a few steps.

If you have uploaded the other plugins first, you will see in the plugin directory that you cannot install other Contribution-related plugins until Guest User is installed first.\n\n\n\n\nGuest User Configuration\n\n\nAfter installing the plugin, click the Configure button. For more information go to the \nGuest User documentation\n.\n\n\nInstalling Contribution\n\n\n\n\nUpload and install the Contribution plugin in the plugin directory.\n\n\nContribution settings: A new tab will appear in the left side navigation bar labeled, \u201cContribution.\u201d Click on Contribution to configure the form and submission settings.\n\n\nNote: a link to the contribution form will automatically be added to the site\u2019s navigation. If you wish you draft the form first, go to the site\u2019s Appearance tab at the top of the Dashboard and click on Navigation. Uncheck the \u201cContribute an Item\u201d link. At this point you can edit the label, or do that later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Contribution\n\n\nContribution is managed from the plugin's tab on the left-hand navigation of the admin dashboard. \n\n\nThe Contribution section has four tabs: Getting Started, Contribution Types, Submission Settings, and Contributions. \n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nThe \nGetting Started\n tab offers instructions for setting up for the form and submission settings.\n\n\nContribution Types\n\n\nThe Contribution Types section is where you choose what type of items users can share through this form (still image, audio, video, document/story), and where you ask questions about what users are sharing. The tab has a table with a row for each type. Every row shows:\n- the type's \nname\n (the label you give it); \n- its \ntype\n (corresponding Item Type from your Omeka install);\n- the number of \nContributed Items\n (which also acts as link to those items);\n- whether \nFile Upload\n is allowed, disallowed, or required; and\n- an \nEdit\n button. \n\n\n\n\nClick \nEdit\n to add or change data collection for a specific type. Click \nAdd\n to create a new type to collect. \n\n\nOn the Add/Edit screen for Contribution Types, there are fields for the display name and form upload, and a series of element inputs for the data you will collect from contributors. \n\n\n\n\nOptions are:\n- \nDisplay Name\n is the label for the contribution type - how it will appear on the public side. If left blank, the form will use the Item Type name.\n- \nAllow File Upload Via Form\n: you can choose to allow, require, or disallow. If this is set to \"required,\" users will not be able to submit the contribution form without attaching a file. \n- \nElements\n: each element appears as a block. \n     - The block is labeled with the Dublin Core field name\n     - \nPrompt\n is what appears on the form. Use this field to ask question or describe what you seek from users, ie, \"Share your story\" or \"When did you take this photograph?\"\n\n     - The \nMultiple Rows\n checkbox sets whether the entry field on the form has a single row (indicating a short answer) or allows for multiple rows (making it easier for contributors to write paragraphs of text).\n\n\nTo add an element (question) to the contribution form:\n- Go \"Add Element\".\n- Select an element from the dropdown list (this includes all the Dublin Core fields as well as all Item Type elements.)\n- Type a prompt or question in the Prompt field.\n- If you want contributors to be able to enter longer blocks of text, click the \nMultiple rows\n checkbox. \n- Save changes.\n\n\nYou can edit any element's prompt or multiple row setting at any time.\n\n\nTo delete an element, click the X button in the right corner of the block and save changes. If you accidentally click the delete button, you can click again (the X changes to an undo arrow) to restore the block.\n\n\n\n\nIn the above image, the upper block has marked for deletion - note that the header for the block is highlighted in red. The lower block is the add element block option with the dropdown open.\n\n\nIf you want users to select from a drop-down instead of entering text, use \nSimple Vocab\n to set up a controlled vocabulary for the element which will be applied on the admin side when adding/editing an item and in contribution forms. \n\n\nIf you want users to be able to assign a location to their contributions, use the \nGeolocation\n plugin and check the \nadd map to contribution form\n in its configuration settings.\n\n\nSubmission Settings\n\n\nIn this section, you set the contribution options for your form, including an option for user anonymity, and provide the text for the email confirmations sent to contributors. \n\n\n\n\nContribution Slug\n: customize the end of the url for the contribution form (youromekasite.net/slug). If you leave this blank, the url for the contribution form will be youromekasite.net/contribution\n\n\n\n\nEmail settings\n\n- \nContribution Confirmation Email\n : An email message will be sent to each contributor from this address confirming that they submitted a contribution to this website. Leave blank if you do not want an email sent.\n- \nNew Contribution Notification Emails\n: Add emails to which you want a notification sent when new contributions are received. You can enter multiple email addresses, separated by a comma.\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n- \nTerms of service\n: paste in text of language of consent for anyone contributing to the site, or make a short statement linking to a \nSimple Page\n with a longer terms of service statement. \n\n\nContributor anonymity settings\n\nTwo checkboxes allow an Administrator to set the user requirements for submitting contributions. \n\n\nThese settings work together to permit varying levels of anonymity for your contributors. For instance, you may require users to sign up and have an approved account before contributing, or you may require them to provide an email before contributing, or you may permit completely anonymous contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow Non-Registered Contributions\n requires that contributors only provide an email address. Select this option if you have set up the Guest User plugin enabling \u201cinstant access.\u201d These contributors will get an email that allows them the option of creating a password for their user account. \n\n\nAllow Anonymous Contributions\n makes it possible for users to make contributions without providing any personal data (no email address). This option can only be used if \nAllow non-registered contributions\n is checked.

Each row in the file represents metadata for a single item.\n\n\nWhen using this plugin, if you plan to map to specific Item Type metadata fields, then you may only import one item type (document, still image, sound, et al) at a time. You may perform multiple imports.\n\n\nThe plugin has the following features:\n\n\n\n\nFile importing: If you specify permanent file URLs in a column, the importer will download and attach a file to each created item. NB: file import only works for files hosted and publicly available online; you cannot import files from a local source (ie, your computer) or from a password-protected location.\n\n\nTag imports: You may include tags in your CSV file and those words will be imported as tags.\n\n\nUndo Imports: The Undo option lets you delete all the files added in an import.\n\n\nSet custom delimiters: you now have the option to set separate delimiters for columns, files, tags, and elements.\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for CSV Import\n\n\nThe best option is usually to use spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers) to create and organize your data. Both of these programs can export a spreadsheet into CSV format, and will handle all the necessary escaping and quoting for you.\n\n\nHowever, if you're creating or editing your data by hand, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to normalize your data before importing. Check to be sure that the first row of your CSV file contains column names, and that every row has the same number of columns.\n\n\nCheck to see if any of the text contains commas, and if it does surround that segment with double-quotes. Many spreadsheet programs will do this for you automatically. If you are using a spreadsheet program, check the CSV that is exported by opening it in a plain text editor to see if the double-quotes are being added automatically.\n\n\nYou can specify a unique delimiter for columns, files, tags, and elements. Once you do, be sure to be consistent in formatting.\n\n\nRemember, every row represents one item, and all items in the file must be the same item type.\n\n\nLook over the Dublin Core and \nItem Type\n metadata to be sure you can easily map the fields in your CSV file to the Omeka installation. Make any modifications in fields or types as necessary.\n\n\nIt is possible to import files housed in a digital repository by adding the URL to that specific file in a column representing a file. You may import more than one file per item, by comma separating the urls within a cell. You must use a permanent link for this step.\n\n\n\n\nImporting\n\n\nA quick note about CSV formats and importing: The column delimiter is the basic building block of the CSV file, and it is a comma by default.\n\n\nEach of the remaining delimiter inputs simply accepts a character that's used to separate multiple values within one \"cell\" of the CSV.\n\n\nIf you are placing multiple values in single cells, the character you're using to separate those values is the delimiter. The plugin allows you to specify different delimiters for cells that contain tags, links to files, or normal element data.\n\n\nTo import, go to the CSV Import tab in the left navigation bar in the admin Dashboard.\n\n\nStep 1: Select File and Item Settings\n\n- Select a CSV file from your computer using the \nChoose File\n button.\n- If using an export from an Omeka CSV report, click the next checkbox, which will override all of the following options. \n- You can use \nAutomap Column Names to Elements\n if you have formatted your column names as follows: \"ElementSetName:ElementSet\", for example DublinCore:Title.\n- \nSelect Item Type\n of the sheet to be imported. NB you can only import one item type at a time. \n- You can also \nSelect Collection\n to which to add the imported items.\n- There are two checkboxes to make all of the imported items \nPublic\n and/or \nFeatured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next four fields are for those who are not using a standard csv for their data:\n\n\nIf you are not using commas to separate your columns, enter the character you are using instead in the \nChoose Column Delimiter\n . Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.\n\n\nIf you have used a character other than a comma to separate tags within individual cells in your CSV file, you must indicate that in the \nChoose Tag Delimiter\n field. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.\n\n\nIf you have used a character other than a comma to separate multiple URLs within a cell (if you are importing items from an outside repository, for example), indicate that in the \nChoose File Delimiter\n field. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.\n\n\nIf any of your metadata fields has more than one element (if your item has more than one creator, for example), please tell the plugin what character you used to separate the elements. If you have more than one element in a a field but leave this blank, the plugin will treat the entire text block as one element. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nNext\n button once you have filled out the above options to your satisfaction. \n\n\nStep 2: Map Columns to Elements, Tags, or Files\n\nOn this next screen, you will see a table which includes each of the Dublin Core fields in Omeka, the text from your CSV file that is designated for that field. The \"Example from CSV file\" column in the table shows the data from the first row of data in your CSV, after the column headings. \n\n\nFor each row in the table (which corresponds to a column in your original CSV) you have the following options: \n-  \nMap to Element\n: Select an element (all of your element sets should be represented) to which to map the column.\n- Click the \nUse HTML\n checkbox if this data includes HTML markup.\n- Click the \nTags?\n checkbox (and do not map to an element) to map this data as \ntags\n\n- Click the \nFiles?\n to map this data as a \nfile\n import. \n\n\n\n\nClick the Import CSV File button to complete the import.\n\n\nYou may check on the progress of your import using the Status tab.\n\n\nUndo an Import\n\n\nTo undo an import:\n-   Click on the CSV Import administrative tab.\n-   Click the Status tab.\n-   Click the Undo link for the Import you want to undo. This will delete all items for this import.\n\n\n\n\nIf your import hangs without completing for an extended period but the link to undo the import does not appear, you can enter the link directly into your browser address bar according to the following example: \nhttp://yourinstallurl/admin/csv-import/index/undo-import/id/idnumberforimport\n\n\nFor example, if your Omeka instance was at the root of example.com and this was your 3rd CSV import, you would use\n\nhttp://example.com/admin/csv-import/index/undo-import/id/3\n. You can hover over the links for previous or subsequent imports to deduce the Import ID.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf you are having trouble with a CSV consistently not importing, try checking for these common issues:\n- Are your file links readable? Try copying and pasting them into the address bar of a browser to see if the link resolves with a file. If it does not, then that may be the issue.\n- Check the encoding on your CSV file. It should be UTF-8\n- Open your CSV file with a different program than the one you created it with and make sure that every row has the same number of columns.\n- Open your CSV file in a text editor and ensure that text blocks are contained in double quotes.",

NB you can only import one item type at a time. \n- You can also  Select Collection  to which to add the imported items.\n- There are two checkboxes to make all of the imported items  Public  and/or  Featured     The next four fields are for those who are not using a standard csv for their data:  If you are not using commas to separate your columns, enter the character you are using instead in the  Choose Column Delimiter  . Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.  If you have used a character other than a comma to separate tags within individual cells in your CSV file, you must indicate that in the  Choose Tag Delimiter  field. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.  If you have used a character other than a comma to separate multiple URLs within a cell (if you are importing items from an outside repository, for example), indicate that in the  Choose File Delimiter  field. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.  If any of your metadata fields has more than one element (if your item has more than one creator, for example), please tell the plugin what character you used to separate the elements. If you have more than one element in a a field but leave this blank, the plugin will treat the entire text block as one element. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space.     Click the  Next  button once you have filled out the above options to your satisfaction.   Step 2: Map Columns to Elements, Tags, or Files \nOn this next screen, you will see a table which includes each of the Dublin Core fields in Omeka, the text from your CSV file that is designated for that field. The \"Example from CSV file\" column in the table shows the data from the first row of data in your CSV, after the column headings.   For each row in the table (which corresponds to a column in your original CSV) you have the following options: \n-   Map to Element : Select an element (all of your element sets should be represented) to which to map the column.\n- Click the  Use HTML  checkbox if this data includes HTML markup.\n- Click the  Tags?  checkbox (and do not map to an element) to map this data as  tags \n- Click the  Files?  to map this data as a  file  import.    Click the Import CSV File button to complete the import.  You may check on the progress of your import using the Status tab.",

            "text": "Current version: 3.3.2\n\n\nThe Exhibit Builder plugin allows you to develop online exhibits, or special web pages, that combine items from your Omeka archive and may include narrative text.\n\n\nExhibits are composed of pages, generally an initial page that introduces your exhibit and subsequent pages composed of the items from your Omeka database that you wish to highlight and/or relate to each other. Exhibit Builder exhibits may be as short as one page or consist of multiple pages. You can make the pages of an exhibit hierarchical.\n\n\nThe layout of exhibits in Exhibit Builder 3.x is highly customizable, with the pages composed of smaller units called blocks. There are three content block types which come with Exhibit Builder 3.x: file with text, gallery, and text block.\n\n\nOther plugins may include their own Exhibit Builder block layouts, if the developer has created them.\n\n\nConfiguring\n\n\nThis plugin is included in your downloaded Omeka installation and does not require a separate download. Select Plugins in the top navigation of your admin. Activate your plugin and select Configure to choose the sequence in which your exhibits appear. Exhibits may be ordered by date added, alphabetically by name, or most recent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the order of your Browse Page Exhibit display from the dropdown menu. \n\n\nDon't forget to save your changes.\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nOnce you have activated and configured the Exhibit Builder plugin, Exhibits should appear in the left navigation bar. Clicking on it will take you to the Browse Exhibits page (admin/exhibits in your installation).\n\n\nTo create an exhibit, go to the Exhibits tab and click the green button labeled \"Add an Exhibit\". \n\n\n\n\nOn the Add Exhibit page, enter the following metadata: \n-   Title: the name of your exhibit, which will be displayed to users\n-   Slug: the abbreviated exhibit name which appears in the url, for example \nhttp://youromekasite/exhibits/show/slug\n\n-   Credits: acknowledgements which will be visible to the public\n-   Description: an introduction or overview for the exhibit\n-   Tags: keywords or themes that give users another option for finding exhibits.\n\n\nOnce you have entered the data, click Save Changes to create your exhibit.\n\n\nThere is an option to select a theme for the exhibit (see below).\n\n\nThe \nUse summary page\n checkbox allows you to decide whether or not to use a summary page. An exhibit summary page displays the exhibit description and navigation options. If this box is unchecked, users navigating to the exhibit will start on the first page of the exhibit.\n\n\nUpload a \ncover image\n to represent the exhibit on browse pages and elsewhere on your site. \n\n\nTheme\n\n\nBy default, your exhibits will display using the same theme as the rest of the site. You may choose a different theme for each exhibit. To do so, select a theme from the dropdown, which will default display \"Current Public Theme.\"\n\n\n\n\nIf you select an option other than \"Current Public Theme\" for your exhibit, you can configure the theme settings for the exhibit by clicking the Configure button which will appear next to the dropdown.\n\n\nAfter selecting a specific theme for exhibit, you can configure that theme by adding a logo, header image, footer text, and copyright information which displays only for that exhibit. \n\n\nNote that if you change the theme, you must click Save Changes before you configure the theme. So if you have been using Berlin and you want to change to the Winter version of Seasons, you will have to click Save Changes after switching from Berlin to Seasons in the Theme dropdown before you can configure the Seasons theme.\n\n\nPages\n\n\nOnce you have created an exhibit you can add pages to it by clicking the Add Page button at the bottom of the Exhibit Metadata page.\n\n\n\n\nOnce on the Add Page screen, add the following:\n\n\n\n\nPage Title: visible to users, used for navigating through the exhibit.\n\n\nPage Slug: an abbreviated exhibit name that appears in the url, for example \nhttp://youromekasite/exhibits/show/exhibit_slug/page_slug\n\n\n\n\nTo save the page information and continue editing that page, click the Save Changes button. To save the basic information for that page and add another page, click the Save and Add Another Page button.\n\n\nOrganizing Pages\n\n\nAn exhibit in Omeka can have multiple pages. You can reorder these pages by dragging and dropping, and you can use drag and drop to set up an exhibit page hierarchy. Note that these hierarchies cannot be more than three levels deep.\n\n\nYou can also delete pages from the Exhibit Metadata page through a two-step process. First, click the large black X on the display bar of the page you wish to delete. Once you click the X, the bar will turn red (see the bar for the page Edward in the image below). Clicking the arrow will undo the delete action. To confirm deleting a page, you must click the Save Changes button. Once pages have been deleted, they cannot be restored.\n\n\n\n\nContent\n\n\nPages are made up of combinations of smaller content units called 'blocks.' There are four basic kinds of blocks: item(s) with text, an item gallery, text only, or a geolocation map (if you have installed the Geolocation plugin). Each page can have one or more content blocks.\n\n\nThe \nFile with Text\n block allows you to pair fullsize or thumbnail files of your items with a block of text. The item files will all be the same size. Text will appear either to the right or left of the item(s). You can use a single item file paired with text, or have multiple item files to the right or left of a block of text.\n\n\nThe \nGallery\n block creates a gallery of item files, generally large square thumbnails. You can add text to the gallery, which will display left or right of the gallery. In a gallery block, you can specify a showcase file, which will appear fullsize either to the right or left of the text. The other gallery images can be placed below the showcase image or beside it, over the text.\n\n\nThe \nText\n block allows you to create a section of text which spans the width of the entire page.\n\n\n\n\nTo add a content block, select the layout you want in the New Block dialog box. Once you have selected the kind you want, click the \"Add new content block\" button. You will have a new block on the page to configure your content.\n\n\nAdding Items\n\n\n\n\nIf you have selected any block other than Text, choose an item by clicking the large plus sign button titled \nAdd Item\n appearing in the Items area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn items browse dialog box pops up showing all of your items.\n\n\n\n\nYou can browse using the back and forth arrow buttons in the upper right corner of the dialog box. \n\n\nClicking \nShow Search Form\n will take you to an advanced item search. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select an item, click on the bar representing it in the Attach an Item window. The right end of the bar will highlight a dark brown \"Select Item\" button. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Select Item to find options for selecting a file and creating a caption for the item. \n\n\n\n\nIf you have more than one file uploaded for an item, you will be able to select which you want to use by clicking on it.\n\n\nAdd a caption in the text field. This will appear in smaller font below the file, not as part of a larger text block. Best practice is to keep it short.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Apply to add the item to the block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the X in the upper right corner of the Attach an Item window at any time to exit the process.\n\n\nOnce you have added an item, you can change the caption or selected file by clicking the edit button which sits across the bottom of the item icon. \n\n\nTo add multiple files from the same item, simply add the same item to the block, choosing a different file to represent the item each time.\n\n\nTo delete items, click the x in the upper right hand corner of the item icon; this will gray out the icon, indicating that it will be deleted the next time you save changes. If you decide not to delete the item, you can click the curved arrow which replaced the x, but you must do so before you save your changes.\n\n\nIn the image below, the middle item has been marked for deletion. A red arrow points to the X to delete the third item.\n\n\n\nExhibit text can be formatted using the \ntext editor bar\n. To write your own html, or paste from somewhere else, click the blue HTML button in the formatting toolbar at the top of the text entry box. This will open up an HTML Source Editor window in which you can work.\n\n\nLayout Options\n\n\nBoth the File with Text and Gallery blocks include layout options to change the look of the exhibit page. To access these options, click the black triangle button to the right of the Layout Options text at the bottom of the block. This will reveal dropdown menus with options for changing the layout.\n\n\nThe \nFile with Text\n block has the following options, all of which are drop-down menus (options listed in parentheses after the dropdown label):\n- File Position (left, right): position of the file relative to the text block.\n- File Size (full-size, thumbnail, square thumbnail): \n- Captions position (center, left, right): the position of the file's caption relative to the file (not the text block)\nWhatever you select affects all of the files for that block equally. The text in this block will stay fixed to the right or left of the file, but will wrap below if the length of the text exceeds the height of the file.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nGallery\n block has the following options, all of which are drop-down menus (options listed in parentheses after the dropdown label): \n- Showcase File Position (no showcase file, left, right): a showcase file is full-size, while the rest of the gallery files are thumbnails. \n- Gallery position (left, right): position of the gallery files relative to the showcase file. If there is no showcase file, the gallery will use the full width of the page.\n- Gallery File Size (square thumbnail, thumbnail): for all files in the gallery except the showcase file.\n- Captions Position (center, left, right): the position of the file's caption relative to its file.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFile\n block has the following options, all of which are drop-down menus (options listed in parentheses after the dropdown label): \n- File Position (left, right, center): position of the file relative to page margins.\n- File Size (full-size, thumbnail, square thumbnail): \n- Captions position (center, left, right): the position of the file's caption relative to page margins (not the file)\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Layouts\n\n\nSome plugins include their own Exhibit Builder content block layouts.\n\n\nIf you have installed the \nGeolocation\n plugin, you will have the\n\nGeolocation Map\n block as an option in your exhibits. This block has no text. Select items which already have been geolocated using the plugin in their item edit page. This block displays as a map across the full width of the page, with markers for the items you select. Any captions you enter will appear in a pop-up inside the map when the item marker is clicked, as will the item file and title.\n\n\nThis image shows a Geolocation block with items added:\n\n\n\nAnd this is how the map looks on the public view of the exhibit page:\n\n\n\nShortcodes\n\n\nExhibit Builder adds specific \nshortcodes\n to your instal which allow you to call specific exhibits or featured exhibits. See the \nplugin shortcodes documentation\n for more information. \n\n\nUpgrading from Exhibit Builder 2.0\n\n\nBefore you upgrade from (Exhibit Builder 2.0)(../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder2.md) to the current version, be sure to \nback up\n your Omeka installation, especially your Exhibit Builder tables.\n\n\nThe upgrade should transform the layouts of your exhibit pages from the old format to the new, without any loss of information. The section below describes how older exhibit layouts should transfer.\n\n\nPrevious Exhibit Builder Layouts\n\n\nThe following is a list of layouts from \nprevious versions of Exhibit Builder\n showing how the old layouts can correspond to new content blocks. These correlations are how pages built in previous versions of Exhibit Builder will be imported when upgrading.\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to reproduce previous layouts using Exhibit Builder 3.0, the content blocks allow for a much wider variety of layouts. For example, rather than having all the files on one side, as in image list left or right, files could alternate sides. You can also combine a Gallery block with File with Text Blocks, or stack multiple Galleries with interpretive text for each set. \n\n\nNB: You cannot change one kind content block (ex. Gallery) to a different kind of content block (ex. File with Text). However, because you can move content blocks around, adding a new block to replace an existing one is less work than in previous versions of Exhibit Builder.\n\n\nBlock \nlayout options\n are in \nitalics\n for Exhibit Builder 3.0 blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit Builder 2 Layout\n\n\nExhibit Builder 3.x Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery-full-left \n\n\nOne gallery block, showcase file position \nleft\n, gallery position \nright\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery-full-right \n\n\nOne gallery block, showcase file position \nleft\n, gallery position \nright\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery-thumbnails \n\n\nOne gallery block, no showcase file. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery-thumbnails-text-bottom \n\n\nOne gallery block with text added, or one gallery block with no text and one text block. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery-thumbnails-text-top \n\n\nOne text block above one gallery block.  \n + \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage-list-left \n\n\nSeries of File with Text blocks, file position \nleft\n, files \nfull size\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage-list-left-thumbnails \n\n\nSeries of File with Text blocks, file position \nleft\n, files \nthumbnail\n or \nsquare thumbnail size\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage-list-right \n\n\nSeries of File with Text blocks, file position \nright\n, files \nfull size\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage-list-right-thumbnails \n\n\nSeries of File with Text blocks, file position \nright\n, files \nthumbnail\n or \nsquare thumbnail size\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nText \n\n\nOne text block \n\n\n\n\n\n\nText-image-left \n\n\nOne File with Text block, file position \nleft\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nText-image-right \n\n\nOne File with Text block, file position \nright\n.",

For example, you can make one item a part of another item, where \"part of\" is the relation. You can also make one item a \"reproduction of\" or a \"translation of\" another item.\n\n\nWe've bundled the plugin with common relations derived from several formal vocabularies, including:\n-  \nDublin Core\n,\n- \nFRBR\n,\n- \nFOAF\n, and\n- \nBIBO\n.\n\n\nYou may use these or create a custom vocabulary* with the relations needed in your site. You could, for example, define custom relations like \"is parent of,\" \"is better than,\" and \"fits within.\"\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nAfter you have \ninstalled\n the plugin, you will need to configure the plugin, from the link on the Plugins page accessed from the top navigation of your admin dashboard.\n\n\nThere are two configuration options:\n- A checkbox to \nAppend to Public Items Show\n.

A corpus is generated by querying the content of a selected text element field. Corpora may then be investigated via ngram graphs, counts, and frequencies.\n\n\nFor additional information on ngrams, please see:\n\n\nBenjamin M. Schmidt, \u201cWords Alone: Dismantling Topic Models in the Humanities,\u201d Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (winter 2012).\n\n\nDan Cohen, \u201cA Conversation with Data: Prospecting Victorian Words and Ideas,\u201d dancohen.org, May 30, 2012.\n\n\nPlease note, your results will be more meaningful when you are working with clean data. Before you begin, ensure that the formatting of your data fields (in particular, those that include numeric sequences like dates) are consistent.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\nThe Ngram plugin requires the following libraries and dependencies:\n- IntlBreakIterator class (in your php)\n- Make sure your php path is properly configured.\n\n\nInstallation and Configuration\n\n\nInstall the plugin.\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve installed it on the server, navigate to the Plugins menu in your Omeka site and click the install button. On installation the plugin automatically creates a Ngram button in the Admin navigation and allows the plugin to be configured on the Plugins page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the plugin.\n\n\nThere are two configuration features for the Ngram plugin:\n\n\nText Element\n: a dropdown menu from which you may select one text element to create an ngram corpus. \n\n\nIn order to produce an ngram, the plugin must be directed to a particular text element. For best results, choose a Text Element by reviewing items within your collection and identify a text field that is meaningful across multiple items. \n\n\nText Elements are listed in a dropdown menu. If you have created unique metadata categories for your collection, these will also be available for selection in the dropdown. You must select a single element. This means you cannot produce ngrams from multiple text fields. \n\n\nFor example, a user might choose to examine a collection of items with useful text in the Description field. Configuring the Text Element to the Description field directs the plugin to create a corpus that includes all items with text in that element. Items that do not have content in this text element will be ignored.\n\n\nNote\n: You may select different text elements for different corpora. However do not modify the Text Element setting while you are in the process of validating items and generating ngrams for a corpus! Doing so will break that process. Only change this once you have generated all ngrams for a corpus.\n\n\nReset processes\n: a checkbox that will reset any ongoing processes that are hanging or showing errors. \nNote: be sure to click to save changes.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Corpus\n\n\nCreate a Corpus\n\n\nA corpus is drawn from the items in your collection with content in a particular text element (which is selected on the plugin configuration page), it is further defined by a Search Query and Sequence elements (on the Add a Corpus page), producing an Item Pool. The Item Pool will be further refined by Validating the Items.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a corpus and start viewing ngrams, go to the Ngram tab on the left hand navigation of your Omeka admin dashboard. On the Browse Corpora page, click the green Add a Corpus button. \n\n\nOn the Add a Corpus page, complete the following options:\n\n\nName\n: A field in which you must give the corpus a name. Ideally, choose something that meaningfully describes the corpora, as there are no descriptions for these corpora.\n\n\nPublic\n: A check box. Click the checkbox to make the corpus visible to public users (on the public side of the site).\n\n\nSearch Query\n: A field in which you refine the contents of your corpus by inputting a search query. The best way to get this search query is to perform an advanced search of the items in your collection on the Admin side of your Omeka site. Then, copy and paste the entire URL of the results, after the part that reads admin/items/browse?\n\n\nSequence\n: \n- \nSequence Element\n: select from elements but it should be something with numeric or date input. Items without the selected element field filled in (for instance, an item without a Date will not be included in the corpus). For best results, ensure consistency of metadata, and select a meaningful field.\n- \nSequence type\n: choose from Date by Year, Date by Month, Date by Day, or Numeric Sequence Range. The field will prompt you with the proper format for the sequence if you choose a Date type. If numeric, make sure the format matches the numeric sequence of the elements you\u2019re drawing from.\n\n\nNote\n: Date should be entered in the YearMonthDay format and should be entered as a range. (for instance, 20010101-20160101)\n\n\nNote\n: You do not have to have a sequence, but without one you cannot generate graphs. \n\n\nNote\n: The Text Element box under the green Add Corpus button on the Add Corpus page. The Text Element was configured in the plugin panel. \n\n\nWhen you have completed adding your corpus, click the green Add Corpus button. \n\n\n\n\nManage your Corpus\n\n\nAfter you have added a corpus, the screen will update with information and options for that corpus.\n\n\n\n\nOn the left the elements that were input on the Add Corpus screen are listed. \n- Public\n- Search Query\n- Browse search results\n- Sequence Element\n- Sequence Range\n\n\nNote\n: Clicking browse Search Results will open a Browse Items page with all the items based on your search term.\n\n\nOn the right, buttons allow the user to Edit and Delete the corpus and Validate Items. After you have validated items, buttons here allow you to generate unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, and to view the corpus. Below, a small pane indicates the Text Element for the corpus.  At the bottom an Item Counts pane will populate a pool of items from which this corpus may be derived. \n\n\n\n\nValidate Items\n\n\nAfter the Corpus has been created you must validate items before you can generate ngrams and view frequencies. To do so, click the green Validate Items button on the right hand side (just below the Delete button).\n\n\n\n\nThis will take you to a new screen with three tabs: valid items, invalid items, and out of range items. \n\n\n\n\nValid items\n are those items with sequence text that is readable to the plugin (See Figure 1). The table on this tab gives: \n- the item number (a link to the item),\n- the text in the sequence element, and\n- Sequence member, or how it will be used in sequence by the plugin (Ex. when the sequence is \u201cDate by Year\u201d and the Sequence. \n\n\nInvalid items\n have text in the sequence element which the plugin cannot parse (See Figure 2). However, you can click on the Item ID number to go in and edit the item to correct the element text. \n\n\nOut of range items\n have text in their sequence element which is outside the range you set (See Figure 3). The table on this tab gives:\n- the item number (a link to the item), \n- the text in the sequence element, and \n- Sequence member, or how it will be used in sequence by the plugin (Ex. when the sequence is \u201cDate by Year\u201d and the Sequence \n\n\nNote\n: to update the sequence text in these items, utilize the linked item number to modify each item. If you do not modify out of range items, they will not be included in the corpus.\n\n\nFor ease of navigation, you may click to open a new tab for the invalid or out of range items you would like to modify. Refresh the list of valid and invalid items by reloading this page. Once you are done correcting invalid items, or the list of valid items looks correct, click the green Accept Valid Items button.\n\n\nNote\n: Once you click the Accept Valid Items button you will not be able to reconfigure the item pool or reset the body of valid items\n\n\nValid Items (Figure 1)\n\n\n\n\nInvalid Items (Figure 2)\n\n\n\n\nOut of Range Items (Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: After you have validated your items, the Item Counts pane will update to provide a count of the number of items in your corpus.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Ngrams\n\n\nAfter you have validated your items, click the buttons to generate unigrams (single words), bigrams (two word pairs), and trigrams (three word groups). You can only do one at a time. Refresh the page to see if the process is complete - larger corpora will take longer to process. While the ngrams are processing, these buttons will be grey and text will update to indicate which process is \u201cIn Progress.\u201d When complete, the text will update to read \u201cGenerated.\u201d\n\n\nYou do not have to generate unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in order to use the View Corpus functions. However, running all three processes before you view corpus will give you more options when analyzing the corpus.\n\n\nNote\n: It is only possible to generate one corpus at a time.\n\n\n\n\nView Corpus\n\n\nOnce you have created a corpus, validated the items, and generated ngrams, you can view the corpus in two ways: Ngram Search and Ngram Frequency.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to get back to the Corpus summary page from the Corpus viewer, click the \u201cback to Corpus\u201d button just under the label Corpus viewer.\n\n\n\n\nNgram Search\n - Using the text field, enter comma-separated phrases or words to graph frequency across the corpus. \n\n\nNote\n: You can only search for two word phrases if you have generated bigrams, etc. \n\n\nYou can, if you want, specify a range for the corpus search. Note that the format of the range you search must match exactly the format of your sequence data. So if you have sequenced the corpus by year, enter a four digit year, whereas if you have done it by month you must enter yyyymm formatted range data.\n\n\n\n\nThe results should return a sequence graph (if they do not, check the formatting of the range data), along with a table showing Ngram Counts and Total Ngram Counts.\n\n\nSequence Graph: Hovering over points on the sequence graph produces a small chart containing data that includes;\n- time period\n- ngram\n- percentage of the ngram in the corpus for a particular time period.\n\n\nNgram Counts: This chart includes information about the ngrams in the corpus. \n- ngram: the phrases or words used to produce the sequence graph.\n- n: number of words in the ngram phrase.\n- Count: total number of that ngram in the corpus.\n- Frequency %: percentage of the ngram in the entire corpus.\n\n\nTotal Ngram Counts: This chart includes information about the corpus.\n- n: the number of words/phrases in an ngram.\n- Total Count: the number of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams in the corpus.\n- Total Unique Count: the number of unique ngrams within the unigrams, bigrams, trigrams.\n\n\nNote\n: These results reflect the composition of the selected corpus (which has been filtered by text element and search query), not the entirety of your collection.  \n\n\n\n\nNgram Frequency\n - The Ngram Frequency Corpus view returns ngrams in order of frequency.\n\n\nEnter the number of results you want to return of unigram, bigrams, or trigrams (select one using the radio button). By default the number of results is set to 100.\n\n\nClicking the Go button produces frequency information, including; the total number and unique number of unigrams/bigrams/trigrams, and a chart that displays the ngram, total count, and a frequency percentage.\n\n\nNote that the ngram plugin does not strip out stop words (a, the, of, for example) so depending on the content of the element that is forming your corpus you may want to enter a larger number in order to return useful results.\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Corpora\n\n\nOnce you have at least one corpus, the page at admin/ngram/corpora (the ngram tab) will display a table of your corpora with the following information for each:\n- \nName\n (that you give it)\n- \nText Element\n being used as the source of the corpus data,  with element set in parentheses\n- \nSequence Element\n, with element set in parentheses\n- \nSequence Type\n\n- \nSequence Range",

This means you cannot produce ngrams from multiple text fields.   For example, a user might choose to examine a collection of items with useful text in the Description field. Configuring the Text Element to the Description field directs the plugin to create a corpus that includes all items with text in that element.

This plugin makes it possible to harvest that metadata, mapping it to the Omeka data model. The plugin can be used for one-time data transfers, or to keep up-to-date with changes to an online repository.\n\n\nCurrently the plugin is able to import \nDublin Core\n, \nCDWA Lite\n metadata, and \nMETS\n. Dublin Core is an internationally recognized standard for describing any resource. \n\n\nEvery OAI-PMH data provider should implement this standard. CDWA Lite is a standard for describing works of art and material culture. Very few repositories expose CDWA Lite, but the standard is getting more and more popular. METS is developed as an initiative of the Digital Library Federation and maintained in the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nYour server must have PHP-CLI 5.2+ installed.\n\n\nUpload and \ninstall\n the OAI-PMH Harvester plugin.

Omeka metadata fields are mapped one-to-one with fields for this output format, and it is the preferred format to use with the plugin.\n- \nCDWA Lite\n (cdwalite)\n    - The mapping between Omeka's metadata and CDWA Lite metadata is more complicated, and certain fields may not be populated correctly. The chief advantage of using CDWA Lite output is that file URLs can be output in a controlled format, unlike Dublin Core. Harvesters may therefore be able to harvest or link to files in addition to metadata.\n- \nMODS\n (mods)\n    - This output crosswalks the Dublin Core metadata to MODS using the \nmapping\n recommended by the Library of Congress.\n- \nMETS\n\n    - The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard exposes files to harvesters.\n\n\nThe plugin uses an extensible architecture, and additional or custom metadata formats may be added.

This value is sent as part of the response to an Identify request, and it is how the repository will be identified by well-behaved harvesters.\n\n\nDefault: The name of the Omeka installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamespace identifier\n\n\nThe \noai-identifier specification\n requires repositories to specify a namespace identifier. This will be used to form globally unique IDs for the exposed metadata items. This value is required to be a domain name you have registered. Using other values will generate invalid identifiers.\n\n\nDefault: \"default.must.change\" This is intended to be a not-so-subtle hint that the default value is inappropriate. The plugin will function with this, or any other string, as the namespace identifier, but this breaks the assumption that each identifier is globally unique. Best practice is to set this value to the domain name the Omeka server is published at, possibly with a prefix like \"oai\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpose files\n\n\nWhether the repository should expose direct URLs to all the files associated with an item as part of its returned metadata. This gives harvesters the ability to directly access the files described by the metadata.\n\n\nDefault: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Configuration\n\n\nThe plugin also allows you to configure some more options about how the repository responds to harvesters. Since the default values are recommended for most users, these values must be edited by hand, in the \nconfig.ini\n file in the plugin's root directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList response limit\n\n\n\n\nNumber of individual items that can be returned in a response at once. Larger values will increase memory usage but reduce the number of database queries and HTTP requests. Smaller values will reduce memory usage but increase the number of DB queries and requests.\n\n\nDefault: 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList expiration time\n\n\n\n\nAmount of time in minutes a resumptionToken is valid for. The specification suggests a number in the tens of minutes. This boils down to the length of time a harvester has to request the next part of an incomplete list request.\n\n\nDefault: 10 (minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtending\n\n\nThis plugin is designed to allow output to arbitrary metadata formats. To add a new format, add a new file to the \nmetadata\n directory, and in the file declare a class extending \nOaiPmhRepository_Metadata_Abstract\n.\nThe only function you must declare is appendRecord, which appends the appropriate XML to the response. You can use the metadata formats shipped with the plugin as examples.\n\n\nImportant notes:\n\n\n\n\nThe class name should be in the \nOaiPmhRepository_Metadata\n hierarchy\n\n\nThe class name must match the file name (i.e., if you create a class \nOaiPmhRepository_Metadata_Foo\n, the filename must be \nFoo.php\n.\n\n\n\n\nUse\n\n\nThe base URL of the repository can be found by appending\n\n/oai-pmh-repository/request\n to the base URL of your Omeka site.",

The chief advantage of using CDWA Lite output is that file URLs can be output in a controlled format, unlike Dublin Core. Harvesters may therefore be able to harvest or link to files in addition to metadata.\n-  MODS  (mods)\n    - This output crosswalks the Dublin Core metadata to MODS using the  mapping  recommended by the Library of Congress.\n-  METS \n    - The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard exposes files to harvesters.

Both can be modified from their original forms to suit specific needs.\n\n\nWhen modifying a included report format, first make a copy of the file, and change both the file name and the class name (so, for example, you could copy \nHTML.php\n to \nHTMLCustom.php\n, and change the class name to \nReports\\_ReportGenerator\\_HTMLCustom\n).\n\n\nThe HTML report format is simple to edit. By default, all the elements in all element sets are printed. You can replace this behavior with printing only specific elements or specific element sets. This is accomplished with the function \n\\_outputSetElements()\n. It takes three arguments. The first is the Item which will be printed, the second is the name of the element set to print, and the third is an array of the specific elements to print.\n\n\nFor example, this is the code that prints all elements for all sets (the default: \n\n\n// Output all the metadata for all the element sets\nforeach($sets as $set) :\n    $this-\n_outputSetElements($item, $set-\nname);\nendforeach;\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, this would cause only Dublin Core elements to be printed:\n\n\n// Output all Dublin Core elements\n$this-\n_outputSetElements($item, 'Dublin Core');\n\n\n\n\nFinally, this would cause only Dublin Core Item elements to be printed, if any:\n\n\n// Output all Dublin Core Title elements\n$this-\n_outputSetElements($item, 'Dublin Core', array('Title'));\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, you can easily create a customized HTML report format.

You may use HTML. (Wrapping paragraph tags recommended.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\nOnce you've installed MediaWiki and the Scripto plugin you can begin transcribing document pages:\n\n\n\n\nOpen an item page as normal (the item must have at least one file);\n\n\nClick on one of the pages (files) under \"Transcribe This Item\". You'll be taken to a user interface where you can view, transcribe, and discuss the selected page;\n\n\nClick \"[edit]\" beside \"Current Page Transcription\", an edit form will open;\n\n\nTranscribe the page and click \"Edit transcription\";\n\n\n\n\nRestricting Access\n\n\nThe Scripto interface is available to all users, but as a MediaWiki administrator you can restrict access to certain actions. By default, anonymous users can edit and revert pages. If you want to restrict these actions, you must \nfollow these\ndirections\n,\nand your users must create MediaWiki user accounts (see below).\n\n\nCreating Accounts\n\n\nScripto uses a separate login procedure from Omeka, so non-anonymous users must have a MediaWiki account and administrators must manage them via MediaWiki. (We recognize that this is not ideal, but the \nMediaWiki API\n does not provide the means to create accounts.) To create an account, users must:\n\n\n\n\nGo to the MediaWiki website\n\n\nClick \"log in / create account\" in the top-right corner\n\n\nClick \"Create an account.\"\n\n\nFill in the information and submit the form\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to allow anonymous account creation, you must \nfollow these directions\n and create accounts for all your users. To create user accounts, you must:\n\n\n\n\nGo to the MediaWiki website\n\n\nClick \"Special pages\" in the toolbar\n\n\nClick \"Log in / create account\" under \"Login / sign up\"\n\n\nClick \"Create an account.\"\n\n\nFill in the information and do one of the following:\n\n\nFill in a password and click \"Create account\"\n\n\nFill in an email and click \"By e-mail\" (The user will receive an email with instructions on how to complete their account creation. You can modify the account creation email by editing the MediaWiki:Createaccount-text page.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting\n\n\nOnce a document or page is transcribed, you may import the transcription from MediaWiki into Omeka. \nImporting a document\n stitches together all its page transcriptions and imports the result to the corresponding item. \nImporting a page\n imports to the corresponding file. All transcriptions are imported to the \"Transcription\" element in the \"Scripto\" element set.\n\n\nImport is only available to MediaWiki administrators. After logging into Scripto via the Omeka interface, two buttons will appear on the transcription page: \"Import Document\" and \"Import Page.\" Just click these buttons to import the transcription from MediaWiki to Omeka.\n\n\nAdvanced Usage\n\n\nRecord Client IP Address\n\n\nScripto does not record a client's IP address by default. All\nmodifications to pages will be set to the IP address of the server running Omeka. To record a client's IP address, you'll need to add the following code to LocalSettings.php:\n\n\n$wgSquidServersNoPurge = array('127.0.0.1');\n\n\n\n\nWhere '127.0.0.1' is your server's IP address.\n\n\nBase64 Decoding\n\n\nScripto Base64 encodes document and page numbers to prevent incompatible MediaWiki title characters. Because of this, corresponding page titles in MediaWiki will be unusually named. You may place the following code in LocalSettings.php to make page titles human readable:\n\n\n// Decode the MediaWiki title from Base64.\n// http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Hooks/BeforePageDisplay\n$wgHooks['BeforePageDisplay'][] = 'fnScriptoDecodePageTitle';\nfunction fnScriptoDecodePageTitle(\n$out, \n$sk, $prefix = '.', $delimiter = '.')\n{\n    $title = strtr($out-\ngetPageTitle(), '-_', '+/');\n    if ($prefix != $title[0]) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    $title = array_map('base64_decode', explode($delimiter, ltrim($title, $prefix)));\n    $title = 'Document ' . $title[0] .

Just sync your library to the Zotero server, tell the Zotero Import plugin what library you want to import, and it'll pull in source items, notes, files, and web snapshots.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nThe plugin imports Zotero libraries and collections, including source items, notes, files, and web snapshots. Web snapshots are zipped up directories containing the files needed to render the web snapshot.\n\n\nTo minimize data loss that often occurs when migrating between systems, the plugin adds a new element set to your Omeka install which contains elements identical to the fields used by Zotero.\n\n\nIn addition to mapping data to the Zotero element set, the plugin maps data to the native Dublin Core element set to maximize interoperability and ease integration with Omeka. The Zotero element set is large, but the plugin provides a helper function to build strings from the elements therein.\n\n\nThe plugin also adds a field to the advanced search page that narrows search results by Zotero item type. Every Zotero item has an item type, so it's a helpful way to sort through your items.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nSync Zotero library\n: The Zotero library must be synced to the Zotero.org server prior to import. To import files, the Zotero client must be set to sync attachment files. You can find     instructions on how to do this at the \nZotero website\n. \n\n\nNote: the import will not work from Zotero Standalone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtom Feed URL\n: Every Zotero library and collection has an Atom feed URL. You can find this URL on the library or collection page of the Zotero website, under \"Subscribe to this feed.\" Unpublished libraries do not have a feed URL readily accessible, but you can construct it using the following URLs as templates:\n\n\nuser library: \nhttps://api.zotero.org/users/%7BuserID%7D/items\n\n\nuser collection: \nhttps://api.zotero.org/users/%7BuserID%7D/collections/%7BcollectionKey%7D/items\n\n\ngroup library: \nhttps://api.zotero.org/groups/%7BgroupID%7D/items\n\n\ngroup collection: \nhttps://api.zotero.org/groups/%7BgroupID%7D/collections/%7BcollectionKey%7D/items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user or group owner can get you the userID, groupID, and\ncollectionID.\n\n\n\n\nPrivate key\n: To access access private libraries and collections and to download attachments (files and web snapshots), a private key is required. A key is not necessary to access citations saved in public libraries and collections. The owner of the library can generate private keys in their \naccount settings\n. Private keys must be set to allow third party access.\n\n\n\n\nPHP Zip extension\n: Zotero stores web snapshots in ZIP files\ncontaining files with \nBase64\n encoded filenames. The import plugin attempts to decode the filenames using \nPHP's Zip extension\n. If your server does not have this extension installed, the plugin does not decode the filenames. The import will still save web snapshots, but the filenames will be obfuscated, making access near-worthless.\n\n\nInstallation and Importing\n\n\nIf you want to import all file types, \nyou must disable file upload validation\n in Omeka Admin \n Settings \n Security Settings before import.\n\n\nOnce you've \ninstalled\n the plugin, go to the \"Zotero Import\" tab in the admin interface and fill out the form (/admin/zotero-import).\n\n\n\n\nTo fill out the form, you will need find the feed URL to the Zotero library you want to import and, if desired or necessary, a private key to access those sources. Click \"Continue\" to begin the importing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the size of the library, the import process may take some time to complete. Because of this we suggest that you log background processes:\n\n\nIn omeka/application/config/config.ini make sure \nlog.processes = true\n\n\nIn omeka/application/logs/ make sure a processes.log file exists and is writable. \n\n\nThese steps are not required but will be helpful if something goes wrong halfway through a long import. It's important to note that the import process is only as stable as the Zotero API. If you encounter errors, delete the import and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStopping and Deleting an Import\n\n\nIf you make a mistake, you may stop an import at any time by clicking \"Stop Import\" in the Zotero Import admin panel. You may also delete the items from an import after the process finishes, by clicking \"Delete Import.\" Deleting imports will delete all imported items and files.",

The necessary process for setting permissions can differ significantly between different servers,\nso it's often best to get specific advice from your hosting provider. This page tries to provide some more general guidance.\n\n\nThe user running the Omeka web process needs \nread\n, \nwrite\n, and \nexecute\n permissions for the \nfiles\n directory and all its subdirectories.\n\n\nThere are three major ways to give the needed permissions. For each option, the names of the permissions needed are provided for use with graphical permissions editors and file transfer programs, and example shell commands are also given for use in SSH.\n\n\nsuExec\n\n\nFor servers using \nsuExec\n (your host will be able to tell you if they are using it), the server executes PHP files using your user account's permissions. This often means you don't need to make any changes at all, since you should already have the proper access to the Omeka files that you unzipped.\n\n\nUnder suExec, you only need to grant write permissions for the \nuser\n.\n\n\nThough it's generally not necessary, you can grant these permissions with this shell command: \n     \nchmod -R 755 files\n\n\nGroup Access\n\n\nFor many other servers, the best option is often to set the directories to a group that Apache belongs to, and then give the group write access to the directories. This option takes a few steps.\n\n\n\n\nFind the correct group to use. Groups vary from server to server, but some common correct groups are \nwww-data\n (the default on Ubuntu and Debian) and \napache\n (the default on CentOS). Your host (or distribution if you run your own server) can tell you the right group to use.\n\n\n\n\nThen, set the group for the files directory and all subdirectories. On the shell, you can use this command (where \ngroup-name\n is the correct group you just found): \n    \nchgrp -R group-name files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, grant read, write, and execute permissions to the \nuser\n and \ngroup\n for the files directory and all subdirectories. On the shell, you can use this command:\n        \nchmod -R 775 files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Access\n\n\nThis is the least secure option. Especially if you are using shared hosting, ask your host for advice before choosing it.\n\n\nYou can also simply give access to the directories to all users on the system. This option is easy, but be sure to ask your host for advice before you choose it. It can be dangerous to give access to all users, and your host should be able to suggest another option.\n\n\nThis option requires read, write, and execute permissions for the \nuser\n, \ngroup\n, and \nworld\n.

You don't need to know how to write code to help translate Omeka, you just need to be fluent in English and another language.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nSign up on Transifex.net\n\n\nOmeka uses \nTransifex.net\n to manage\ntranslations. To start helping to translate Omeka into other languages, you will first need to \nsign up for an account\n. Transifex.net offers several\nplans, but since Omeka is an open-source project, you can use the Free plan.\n\n\nJoin or start a language team\n\n\nOnce you have registered for an account, visit the \nOmeka project page\n and click on the \"Teams\" tab. This will show you the teams working on translations of Omeka into different languages.\n\n\nHere, you have two options. If you want to start work on a translation into a language which is not already being worked on, click the \"Request a new team\" button, and select the language that you want to work on. Once that request is approved, you will be the coordinator for that language.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if someone has already created a team for the\nlanguage you want to work on, click the name of the language, and on the next screen click the \"Join this Team\" button. It will be up to the coordinator to approve your request to be a member of the team.\n\n\nOnce a coordinator has approved you to the team, you can click on the \"Omeka \u2192 core\" link and begin translating.\n\n\nIf you want to check your translation or anything else you need to make an mo file from your po file, you can do it with msgfmt from the \nGNU gettext package\n.\n\n\nFor Transifex-specific issues, please see their \ndocumentation\n\n\nTranslation Guidelines\n\n\nMost of the strings to be translated in Omeka are straightforward and can be translated directly. However, there are a few special cases that need to be treated with care.\n\n\nPlaceholders\n\n\nSome strings contain text that looks like \n%s\n or \n%1$s\n. These odd-looking bits of text are called \nplaceholders\n.
