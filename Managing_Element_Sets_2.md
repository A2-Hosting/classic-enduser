Managing Element Sets 2.0
=========================

Element Sets are standardized metadata categories that enable you to
consistently classify, identify, and sort the digital resources in your
Omeka database. Element Sets utilize standardized Dublin Core metadata
fields enabling you to classify the items in your database by content,
format, and administrative details surrounding stewardship such as
rights and preservation.
