Describing Items
--------------------------------------------------------

All items in your Omeka archive have core and item type metadata - or the information that will help describe an item. Each item may belong to one collection and may be tagged with an infinite number of keywords. Items will be used to build exhibits.

Each item contains descriptive metadata. By default, Omeka uses the guidelines established in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative:[http://dublincore.org](http://dublincore.org) to standardize item records. This will make the sharing of data across Omeka, and other platforms, installations possible.

It is also possible to install another element set (see[Managing_Element_Sets](Managing_Element_Sets.md)), or you may create a new element set, (see
[Creating_an_Element_Set](Creating_an_Element_Set.md)).

### Dublin Core Fields

The following Core fields are available for all Omeka items, and by default are displayed first on the public item pages.

**Title:** A name given to the resource.

**Subject** The topic of the resource. Typically, the topic will be represented using keywords, key phrases, or classification codes. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary. To describe the spatial or temporal topic of the resource, use the Coverage element.

**Description** An account of the resource. Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, a table of contents, a graphical representation, or a free-text account of the resource.

**Creator** An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.

**Additional Creator** A second entity responsible for making the resource.

**Source** The resource from which the described resource is derived. The described resource may be derived from the related resource in whole or in part. Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system. (CMS, Accession number)

**Publisher** An entity responsible for making the resource available.

**Date** (YYYY-MM-DD) A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource. Date may be used to express temporal information at any level of granularity. Recommended best practice is to use an encoding scheme, such as the W3CDTF profile of ISO 8601
[W3CDTF](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).

**Contributor** An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.

**Rights** Information about rights held in and over the resource. Typically, rights information includes a statement about various property rights associated with the resource, including intellectual property rights.

**Rights Holder** A person or organization owning or managing rights over the resource. Recommended best practice is to use the URI or name of the Rights Holder to indicate the entity.

**Relation** A related resource. Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system.

**Spatial Coverage** The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant. Spatial topic may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). Where appropriate, named places or time periods can be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges. (using only spatialâ€”Getty Thesaurus Geographic names)

**Temporal Coverage** (YYYY-MM-DD) From to Date range.

**Language** A language of the resource.

**Provenance** A statement of any changes in ownership and custody of the resource since its creation that are significant for its authenticity, integrity and interpretation. The statement may include a description of any changes successive custodians made to the resource.

**Bibliographic Citation** A reference note composed in the style appropriate for your project.
