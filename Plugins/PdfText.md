Plugins/PdfText
===============


[Plugins](../Plugins.1.html "Plugins")


PdfText enables searching on PDF files by extracting their texts and
saving them to their file records. PdfText strips out images and layout
in the original file, leaving only searchable text which is viewable
from site admin.

Using the PdfText plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Upload and install the PdfText plugin (see [Installing a Plugin](../Managing_Plugins_2.0.html#Installing_a_Plugin "Managing Plugins 2.0"))

Configure PdfText. If PDF files are already in your Omeka database when
you install the plugin, you can configure PdfText to run the text
extraction process on those items. Just check the box and remember to
save changes.
