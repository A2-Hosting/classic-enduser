Plugins/ExhibitBuilder 2.0
==========================


[Plugins](../Plugins.1.html "Plugins")


The Exhibit Builder plugin allows you to develop online exhibits, or
special web pages, that combine items from your Omeka archive with
narrative text.

Exhibits are composed of pages--generally an initial page that
introduces your exhibit and subsequent pages composed of the items from
your Omeka database that you wish to highlight and/or relate to each
other. Exhibits compiled with Exhibit Builder may be one or several
pages long and may include a variety of layouts which you may chose from
a selection of page templates.


Configuring
--------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin is included in your Omeka installation and does not require
a separate download. Select Plugins in the top navigation of your admin.
