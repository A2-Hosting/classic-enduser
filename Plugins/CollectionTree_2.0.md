Plugins/CollectionTree 2.0
==========================

[Plugins](../Plugins.1.html "Plugins")

Collection Tree plugin allows Omeka sites to have nested collections.
One collection can have at most one parent collection, but a collection
may have zero or multiple child collections.

Working with Collection Tree
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Upload and install the Collection Tree plugin (see [Installing a Plugin](../Managing_Plugins_2.0.html#Installing_a_Plugin "Managing Plugins 2.0"))

1.  On installation, the plugin automatically creates a tab in the Admin
    navigation called Collection Tree where your nested collections are
    listed hierarchically.

Nesting Collections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can nest collections after you have created two or more in the
Collection section. Read more about
[Managing\_Collections\_2.0](../Managing_Collections_2.0.html "Managing Collections 2.0").

-   Select Collections in the Admin navigation, then add a collection.


-   To nest a collection, select the Parent Collection tab that appears
    at the top of page when adding or editing a collection.

-   From the dropdown menu, select the parent collection for the
    collection you have just created. This selection nests your
    collections, creating a collection tree.

 If you wish, you may make the Collection Tree's hierarchy viewable to
the public, go to the Appearance tab in the top Admin navigation bar.
Then, click on Navigation, and check or uncheck the Collection Page.
