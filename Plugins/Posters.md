Posters are a simple, lightweight way for users on your site to interact
with your content by selecting items to gather together into a
sequential presentation, with an overall description and captions for
items.

You must have [Guest User](GuestUser_2.0.html "Plugins/GuestUser 2.0")
installed to use Posters.

<span id="Configure" class="mw-headline"> Configure </span>
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Poster Page Title:** Change the title of the posters page and how it
is populated in the public navigation

**Poster Page Path:** the slug for the poster page (what shows up in the
url, so youromekasite.org/posters )

**Poster Page Disclaimer:** Edit, replace, or remove the default
disclaimer that appears at the bottom of every poster page.

**Poster Page Help:** Edit, replace, or remove the default text for
posters/help, accessible to users when they are creating or editing a
poster.

**Poster File Size:** Use these drop-down menus to indicate the image
size (fullsize or thumbnail) for display on the public page and when
printing posters.

**Poster Display Show:** Page From this drop-down, you can choose
whether posters display online as a static list of items or a carousel
slide show. Note that the carousel display is designed for shorter
descriptions and posters of at least two items.

### <span id="Default_Texts" class="mw-headline"> Default Texts </span>

If you replace the default texts and later want to restore them, they
are as follows:

**Poster Page Disclaimer** This page contains user-generated content and
does not necessarily reflect the opinions of this website. For more
information, please refer to our terms of service and conditions. If you
would like to report the content of this as objectionable, please
contact us.

**Poster Page Help** &lt;h2&gt;Your Posters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build
a poster, you may use any public item in in this website and add a
caption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the button that says "New Poster."
Assign a title to your poster, add a short description. Click the tab
that says "Add an Item" and select any item that you wish to include in
your poster. Continue adding items and captions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be
sure to save your poster. You may return to edit your poster at any
time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may print this poster, or share it by
email.&lt;/p&gt;

<span id="Posters" class="mw-headline"> Posters </span>
-------------------------------------------------------

Users add, edit, share, print, and delete posters from the public side
of your Omeka installation. Once the plugin has been installed, there
should be link in your main navigation menu on the public side called
“Posters” (or the text you entered in the Poster Page Title field when
configuring the plugin.

Note that logged-in users will only see their own posters. Non-logged in
people who navigate to youromekasite.org/posters will see all posters
with the option to print any of them.

### <span id="Build_a_Poster" class="mw-headline"> Build a Poster </span>

To create a new poster, go to the public posters page and click the Add
a Poster button. This will take to you to a new page where you can
create your poster.

Enter the title of the poster. The title will display on the posters
page as well as at the top of the printed version.

Add a description. The first 200 characters will appear on the Posters
page. To add items, click the Add an Item button. This will open a
pop-up window which allows you to browse or search your items in order
to add them. Click on an item and then click the brown Select Item
button to add it to your poster.

[![Pb1.jpg](https://omeka.org/c/images/7/70/Pb1.jpg)](https://omeka.org/codex/File:Pb1.jpg)

Every item you add will have a caption field. Bear in mind that in
carousel view text does not wrap, so your caption will need to be
concise.

Once you have added a number of items, you can change their order by
using the buttons located between the thumbnail file and the caption
field. These buttons are: move to top (double up); move up one (single
up); move down one (single down); move to bottom (double down); delete
item (X).

the dashboard.

To view your poster, click the poster title from the Posters page.

**Edit** You can access this same page at any time by clicking edit
under the poster title on the Posters page.

**Delete** If you click delete below the title on the posters page, you
will be asked to confirm before the poster is deleted. To cancel, simply
click the back button in your browser.

**Share Poster** Takes you to a new page where you can enter an email
address; poster Builder will send a link to your poster’s webpage to
that address with the message “Username shared a poster with with you.

one page, suitable for printing.

### <span id="Manage_Posters" class="mw-headline"> Manage Posters </span>

their own posters on the public side. However, they can access all
posters through the Posters tab on the left-hand navigation on the admin
dashboard.

Administrators and Super Users can delete posters created by any user
via the Posters tab on the left side of the admin dashboard. You will be
asked to confirm before the item is deleted.
