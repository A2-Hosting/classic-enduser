Plugins/GuestUser 2.0
=====================


[Plugins](../Plugins.1.html "Plugins")

About Guest User 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Guest User plugin adds an additional user role to your Omeka site.
The Guest role works behind the scenes with other plugins (Commenting,
and User Profiles, for example), without giving the guests admin access
to your Omeka site.

Install and Configure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After
[installing](../Managing_Plugins_2.0.html#Installing_a_Plugin "Managing Plugins 2.0")
the plugin, you should be automatically redirected to the configuration
settings for the plugin. You can access these again at any time by
clicking the Configure button for Guest User from the Plugins menu.

You can enter text for the following fields:

-   Registration Features: this text will appear at the top of the
    registration page. You can use it to explain what users are signing
    up to do, and what the limitations may be.
-   Short Registration Features: brief text appearing as a dropdown from
    the user bar.
-   Dashboard Label: By default, this is "My Account" and will appear
    when the user is logged in.
-   Login Text: What is displayed for the login button, defaults
    to Login.
-   Register Text: What is displayed for the Register link, defaults
    to Register.

There are also two checkboxes:

-   Allow open registration to allow individuals to register without
    administrators approving their accounts.
-   Allow instant access enables new users to access their accounts for
    20 minutes after registering without administrator approval.

If you have [ReCaptcha enabled](https://omeka.org/codex/ReCaptcha), you
can require a ReCaptcha key for registration.

Using the Plugin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to note that almost all the functionality of the will be
with other plugins; Guest user does not do much on its own. You will
have to do additional configuration within other plugins (User Profiles,
for instance) to realize the full benefits of the Guest User plugin.
