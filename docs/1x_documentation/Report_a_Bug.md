Report a Bug
============

## Before Reporting a Bug 
------------------------------------------------------------

Always check to see if it has already been reported. Although we try our best to avoid any problems with the software, whenever there is a bug, we often hear about it 10 times as a credit to the great user community we have. Use the search bar in the upper-right of the website to make sure it hasn't already been discussed on the forums or in another place. If your problem is different -- tell us about it.

## Who Posts Bugs and Where
-------------------------

Users of varying technical skill will report bugs in different places.

We encourage novice users to post bugs to the [forums](../forums/topic/mysqli-stmt.bind-result.html) if they think somethings broken, but don't know why. For users who have an interest in
hacking and developing code with Omeka, the [developer mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/omeka-dev/) is to discuss and look under the hood for code fixes. Sometimes these bugs affect the core of the software, and sometimes they require basic modifications to a user's theme or plugin. Power users and developers can report bugs directly in our issue tracker on [GitHub](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka).
