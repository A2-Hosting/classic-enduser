The Google Translate plugin offers users the ability to translate the administrative interface into a language of their choice. The plugin relies on the [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/) toolkit.

1.  Install and activate the plugin.
2.  After the plugin is activated, a small drop-down list of many languages will appear in the admin and public theme footer. The default language is always English.
3.  Keep in mind that users--admin and public--must choose the language each time they revisit the website. This plugin may not be a perfect translation of all elements in your site, but it does provide an easy way to make a site available to a diverse group of language speakers.
