Omeka 1.2.1 was released on June 23, 2010.

Core Changes
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Omeka 1.2.1 fixes a security flaw in the Omeka theme configuration. This applies only to the themes configuration feature that was new in 1.2, so Omeka installations using older versions are not affected. No changes are required for plugins and themes.
