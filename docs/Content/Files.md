title: Managing Files 2.0
---

When adding [items](/Managing_Items_2.md) to your archive, often you will upload one or more files (images, documents, et al) associated with that item.

File Types
-------------------------------------------------------------

Omeka accepts most files and file types. If you are having difficulty or receiving MIME Type errors, please see more information about adjusting the MIME Types or Accepted File Extensions in the section on [managing security settings](Managing_Security_Settings_2.md).

File Display Order
---------------------------------------------------------------
Once files are added to an item, you may click and drag the files into the preferred display order for both public and admin item pages.

Files with Thumbnails
-------------------------------
Thumbnail previews are created for all files types in Omeka 2.0. If you have access to the config.ini file, you can manage [thumbnail configuration](/Configuring_Thumbnail_Creation.md)

File Size Limitations
-----------------------------
Please check with your server administrator, because these settings are server specific and not imposed by the Omeka system.

These limitations vary from server to server and we cannot change this for you. If you have a problem uploading files, please first check with your hosting service or your local server administrator.

Batch Add Files
---------------------------------------------------------------

To upload more than one file at a time, you may download and install the [Dropbox](/plugins/Dropbox.md) plugin. It allows you to upload multiple files directly into a folder on your server that you can then add in the items admin interface. 

File Metadata
--------------------------------------------------------------
You may add full Dublin Core metadata for every file uploaded.

To add metadata, click the Edit button found to the right of the file name in admin/items/edit. You also may view or edit file metadata from the admin/items/show by clicking the file name under the heading "File Metadata."
