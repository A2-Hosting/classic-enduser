title: Managing Tags
---

Tags are keywords or phrases that describe a piece of data. They are non-hierarchical labels that classify your content so that it is easily found. You can add tags to [Items](Items) and [Exhibits](../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder).

To manage your tags, sign into the Omeka admin panel and select Tags from the left-hand navigation bar. This displays all the tags associated with records in your Omeka instllation. You may edit and delete tags, sort tags, and view items associated with individual tag.

Edit Tags Page
---------------
On the Edit Tags page, all tags used in your installation appear on the right side of the page, while on the left, next to the navigation, are options for search and an explanation of the tag display.

Each tag used on your site appears as a unit which gives you the following (per the number labels in the above image): 1. the number of items with that tag; 2. the name of the tag; 3. the option to delete the tag.

### Sort Tags
Above the cluster of tags are four button options for sorting the tags. From left to right, they are:

- **Count:** Initially sorts tags by number of associated records with the largest number first. Click again, so that the arrow which appears next to it points up, to sort with the smallest number occurrences first. 
- **Alphabetical:** The default sort for tags, sorts in alphabetical order. Click again to sort in reverse alphabetical order (arrow will point down)
- **Time:** Sorts records by date created. Default is oldest tags first.

- **Record Types:** If you have tags on exhibits as well as items, you can narrow down the tags displayed to show only those associated with items or those associated with exhibits.
	- From the Record Types dropdown, select from the following options: All (View all), Items, Exhibits.
	- Note that if you do not have any exhibits tagged, 

### View Tagged Items
To view items associated with an individual tag, you need to be viewing *only* tags associated with Item record types. 

1. From the Record Type filter, choose Items.
2. Find the tag whose items you want to view
2. Click on the number to the left of the name of your tag
3. A browse page opens displaying only items tagged with the tag you clicked.

## Edit a Tag 
You can rename a tag from this page. Tags edited in the admin panel change on all items across the site wherever they appear.

To edit a tag:

-   Click on the name of the tag you wish to edit.
-   Enter changes you would like to make in the field.
-   Hit Enter and your tag is saved with its new name.

When editing, you cannot use an existing tag. So, for example if you have 5 tags for "banana" and two for "bananana", you cannot change the misspelled tag to the right spelling. You would need to go into the items with the tag you want to remove, add the tag you prefer, and then delete (see below) the tag with the misspelling.

Delete a Tag 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Deleting a tag removes all occurrences of that tag across all items.

To delete a tag:

-   Choose the tag you wish to delete from the select menu
-   Select the X to the right of the tag.
-   A window will open with the question, "Are you sure?" 
-   Click Delete, and that tag is permanently deleted across your Omeka items. (If you change your mind, close the query window by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner.)

Sort Tags
-----------------------------------------------------------
The menu above your tags display allows you to sort all of your tags.

The browse tags panel displays all the tags associated with items in your archive, weighted by frequency used. You may sort and view all your tags by *most* frequently used, by *least* frequently used, *alphabetically*, or by most *recent* tags.
