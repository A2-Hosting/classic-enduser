If you would like to try Omeka before installing on your own server, consider signing up for a free basic account at

Omeka.net is web-publishing platform that allows anyone with an account to create or collaborate on a website to display collections and build digital exhibitions. With the [Basic](https://www.omeka.net/signup) plan, you can experience Omekaâ€™s administrative dashboard and try out fourteen plugins, including Exhibit Builder and Simple Pages.

For a comparison of the features of a hosted account at Omeka.net and an installation on your own servers, see the [Omeka.net About page](http://info.omeka.net/about/).
