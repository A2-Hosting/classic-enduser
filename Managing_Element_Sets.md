Managing Element Sets
=====================


Manage element sets by clicking on the Settings button in the right
corner of your dashboard, or by going to, /admin/settings. The Element
Sets tab allows you to review and delete element sets available in your
Omeka installation.

Deleting an Element Set
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deleting an element set removes all fields associated with that element
set from your database, and removes all data in items that were added to
those fields. Unless you've backed up your database, this data is not
recoverable.

To delete an element set, simply click on the "Delete" button beside the
element set you wish to delete.

Adding New Element Sets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New element sets can be added with plugins. See [Creating an Element
Set](Creating_an_Element_Set.html "Creating an Element Set") for more
information.
