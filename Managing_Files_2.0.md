Managing Files 2.0
==================

When adding items to your archive, often you will upload one or more
files (images, documents, et al) associated with that item.

File Types
-------------------------------------------------------------

Omeka accepts most files and file types. If you are having difficulty or
receiving MIME Type errors, please see more information about adjusting
the MIME Types or Accepted File Extensions in
[Managing\_Security\_Settings\_2.0](Managing_Security_Settings_2.0.html "Managing Security Settings 2.0").

File Display Order
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once files are added to an item, you may click and drag the files into
the preferred display order for both public and admin item pages.

Files with Thumbnails
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thumbnail previews are created for all files types in Omeka 2.0. If you
have access to the config.ini file, you can manage [thumbnail
configuration](Configuring_Thumbnail_Creation.html "Configuring Thumbnail Creation")

File Size Limitations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please check with your server administrator, because these settings are
server specific and not imposed by the Omeka system.

These limitations vary from server to server and we cannot change this
for you. If you have a problem uploading files, please first check with
your hosting service or your local server administrator.

Batch Add Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To upload more than one file at a time, you may download and install the
Dropbox plugin. It allows you to upload multiple files directly into a
folder on your server that you can then add in the items admin
interface. Learn how to use the
[Dropbox\_2.0](https://omeka.org/c/index.php?title=Dropbox_2.0&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dropbox 2.0 (page does not exist)")

File Metadata
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You may add full Dublin Core metadata for every file uploaded.

To add metadata, click the Edit button found to the right of the file
name in admin/items/edit. You also may view or edit file metadata from
the admin/items/show by clicking the file name under the heading "File
Metadata."
